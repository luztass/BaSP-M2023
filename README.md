# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 01
### _Creating a screenflow in Figma_
During week 01 we had to familiarize with the application [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), which is a collaborative interface design tool. Our first project was to create a screenflow for a company called "Mega Rocket."

![Hello, trainer  Welcome back!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127448693/227731139-be73996d-fee2-4096-8d37-920dc97c3f2b.png)

_Mega Rocket_ is a gym with members and employees who are able to access the web we designed. This web system had to facilitate the management of schedules and the trainers in charge of each class. 

Together with my team we had to create the coach/trainer's screenflow.

> The trainer's profile entered the platform 
>  using an email and password and on the main
> screen they could see the schedule of
> activities to which they were assigned. They
> had access to a view of the basic personal
> information of the members enrolled in the
> activities and the type of membership each one
> has in order to provide a more personalized
> service. From the profile they could see and
> modify their personal data. Lastly, they had to
> have at least one assigned activity (weight
> training, boxing, spinning, crossfit).


## Week 02
### _Creating an HTML document_
During week 02 we had to learn how to use Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/) and learn how to create a HTML document. 

We created an HTML document with the same content as the screenflow landing of the first week adding all the content that is visible (title, subtitles, date, text, images, links, etc.) respecting the semantic elements of HTML and saving progress to a public Github repository. 

These were the steps to follow:

- Create a repository on [Github](https://github.com/) called: “BaSP-M2023”.
- Create a folder on the computer called “BaSP-M2023”. 
- Initialize git by configuring the remote repository. 
- Create an _index.html_ file and recreate the landing.
- Add in the root folder "BaSP-M2023" a Readme.md file.
- Make commits and push with progress.
