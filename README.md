# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 01
During week 01 we had to familiarize with the application figma, which is a collaborative interface design tool. Our first project was to create a screenflow for a company called "Mega Rocket." Mega Rocket is a gym with members and employees who are able to access the web we designed. This web system had to facilitate the management of schedules and the trainers in charge of each class. 
Together with my team we had to create the coach/trainer's screenflow. The trainer's profile entered the platform using an email and password and on the main screen they could see the schedule of activities to which they were assigned. They had access to a view of the basic personal information of the members enrolled in the activity(ies) and the type of membership each one has in order to provide a more personalized service.
From the profile they could see and modify their personal data.
Lastly, they had to have at least one assigned activity (weight training, boxing, spinning, crossfit).

## Week 02
During week 02 we had to learn how to use Git and GitHub and learn how to create a HTML document.
