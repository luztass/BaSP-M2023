# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 01
### *Creating a screenflow in Figma*
During week 01 we had to familiarize with the application [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), which is a collaborative interface design tool. Our first project was to create a screenflow for a company called "Mega Rocket."

_Mega Rocket_ is a gym with members and employees who are able to access the web we designed. This web system had to facilitate the management of schedules and the trainers in charge of each class. 

Together with my team we had to create the coach/trainer's screenflow.

> The trainer's profile entered the platform 
> using an _email and password_ and on the main
> screen they could see the schedule of
> activities to which they were assigned. They
> had access to a view of the basic personal
> information of the members enrolled in the
> activities and the type of membership each one
> has in order to provide a more personalized
> service. From the profile they could see and
> modify their personal data. Lastly, they had to
> have at least one assigned activity (weight
> training, boxing, spinning, crossfit).

To create the screenflow we had to follow these steps below:
- Download and create an account in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- Create the screens in a coherent and cohesive way having into account colours and being consistent in the design.
- Using the prototype tool to make all the connections possible to create the screenflow.
- Make corrections and work on edition.

## Week 02

### *Creating an HTML document*

During week 02 we had to learn how to use Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/) and learn how to create a HTML document. 

During this second week, the task was completed individually. I created an HTML document with the same content as the screenflow landing of the first week adding all the content that was visible (title, subtitles, text, images, links, etc.) respecting the semantic elements of HTML and saving progress to a public Github repository. 

These were the steps to follow:

- Create a repository on [Github](https://github.com/) called: “BaSP-M2023”.
- Create a folder on the computer called “BaSP-M2023”. 
- Initialize git by configuring the remote repository. 
- Create an _index.html_ file and recreate the landing.
- Add in the root folder "BaSP-M2023" a Readme.md file.
- Make commits and push with progress.

## Week 03

### *Using CSS*

During week 03 our aim was to include the corresponding styles to the HTML structure of week 02 to ensure that it looks identical to the landing of the screenflow of week 01 in the desktop view. The progress has been saved within the same public [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository from week 02. 

This week we had to follow these steps below:

- Read our tutors' feedback and correct the mistakes in the HTML structure of week 02.
- Create a new folder called Week-03 inside the repository created last week.
- Copy the index.html created in week 02 and paste it into the new folder.
- Create a CSS file to style the HTML and achieve an identical look to the screenflow landing from week 01.
- Make commits and save the changes to GIT and push them to Github.
- Update the README.md file.

### *Learning about CSS*

In order to learn how to use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) we had material available so as to have enough practice. It was important to learn new syntax (selectors, declarations, properties and values) and acquire enough knowledge to be able to fix the first HTML and style it to achieve an identical look to the landing page of MegaRocket SA's webpage.

## Week 04
## *Responsive Design*

### Project

Now that we have our HTML corrected and we've added styles to our landing page using CSS, during week 04 we have to focus on using **Flexbox** to create a Responsive Design following the concept of *Mobile First*.

The main menu of our lading page should be in the left sidebar with links when viewed from a desktop PC, but when viewing the web from a mobile phone the vertical bar should disappear and only the icon ☰ will be displayed. It is important for the landing to be complete, functional and displayed correctly on any device.

**What is the concept "Mobile First"?**

> A “Mobile First” approach involves designing a 
> desktop site starting with the mobile version, which
> is then adapted to larger screens (contrary to the
> traditional approach of starting with a desktop site
> and then adapting it to smaller screens).

**Flexbox**
> The _Flexible Box Model_ is a one dimensional layout model that provides a method to offer space distribution and powerful alignment capabilities.
> The _flex container_ is the element that holds _flex items_. Flex items are direct children of flex containers. 

Before Flexbox, we aligned elements using **floats** and **tables**. This was rather difficult during week 03.

This week we had to follow these steps below:

- Create a Week-04 folder inside our repository.
- Create necessary css files to guarantee the reuse of these styles in the future.
- Start developing the mobile version and apply CSS Flexbox rules so that the same content is adapted for mobile phones, tablets and desktop, avoiding using media-queries.
- Separate the CSS code in the different files created.
- Enable **Github Pages** to be able to view the online front page from the Github page (link below).
- Update the Readme document to include the Github Pages link to view the output.
