# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 01
### _Creating a screenflow in Figma_
During week 01 we had to familiarize with the application [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), which is a collaborative interface design tool. Our first project was to create a screenflow for a company called "Mega Rocket."

_Mega Rocket_ is a gym with members and employees who are able to access the web we designed. This web system had to facilitate the management of schedules and the trainers in charge of each class. 

Together with my team we had to create the coach/trainer's screenflow.

> The trainer's profile entered the platform 
>  using an email and password and on the main
> screen they could see the schedule of
> activities to which they were assigned. They
> had access to a view of the basic personal
> information of the members enrolled in the
> activities and the type of membership each one
> has in order to provide a more personalized
> service. From the profile they could see and
> modify their personal data. Lastly, they had to
> have at least one assigned activity (weight
> training, boxing, spinning, crossfit).
